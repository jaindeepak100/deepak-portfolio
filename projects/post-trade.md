Position reconciliation system
Ensure that the positions reported by front office systems match the positions reported by the custodian or broker. It involves comparing the security, quantity, and value of the positions, and investigating any differences
This advanced reconcillation system store and reconcile positions, categorize the breaks and reduces any manual overheads to resolve breaks.

In this project I gained experience with a Java Spring applications with a postgres database.
